## Best practices

###  Describe your code

It is very important for your future self, and for any person that will be reading/using your code to be able to understand what the **code**, **function** or **RMardown** will generate. Therefore it is cructial to describe what the code does, acknowledge the author, the date it was written,and give an example on how to execute it.

Example:

```{r}
# Code developded by Maria Izabel - 3/12/18
# The following function outputs the sum of two numeric variables (a, b). 
# usage: summing(a=2, b=3)

summing <- function(a, b){
  return(a+b)
}

summing(a=2, b=3)
```

The example above is summing up two different numeric variables. Note that the name I chose for this function was **summing**, instead of **sum**. This is because we know that R already has a built-in function called **sum** and therefore we don't wanna overwrite it!

### Exercise: Creating your own function and describing it
Time: 10 min

Follow the code above to create your code. Open a RMarkdown document and create a R chunk. Instead of summing two variables you are asked to subtract them. Please find a meaningful name for your function and make sure the name you choose is not already used by R. Run the entire chunk (pressing the green arrow in the up-right corner) and make sure no errors are given!

### Load Packages 

After describing your code in the first lines of your document, use the library function to list and load all the relevant packages needed to execute your code.

Example:
```{r, eval=F}

library(ggplot2); library(dplyr)
```

### Indent your code

Even though R does not care about how well indented your code is, it is a great idea to do it so, because it makes it easier to read, especially, if there are multiple nested statements like For-loop and If statement.

### Exercise: Indenting a bad code
Time: 10 min

The following code works but it has no indentation or clarity. In the following minutes you will indent the code, run it, understand what the function is outputing and increase the flexibility of the function (you can include a "product" operation, for instance)

```{r}

operations <- function(a, b, character_operation){if(character_operation == "-"){results = a-b}
  if(character_operation == "+"){results = a+b}
  if(character_operation == "/"){results = a/b}
return(results)
}
```

### Comment your code!
Whenever we are dealing with many codes of lines, it is important to comment on what possible functions important lines of the code would have. You can use the symbol **#** to make comments:

```{r}
# This function converts temperature in fahrenheit to kelvin
fahrenheit_to_kelvin <- function(temp_F) {
  temp_K <- ((temp_F - 32) * (5 / 9)) + 273.15
  return(temp_K) # it returns a numeric value
}

# The following function converts kelvin to celsius
kelvin_to_celsius <- function(temp_K) {
  temp_C <- temp_K - 273.15 # The 273.15 value is based on the Charle's Law.
  return(temp_C)
}

# The following function converts fahrenheit to celsius
fahrenheit_to_celsius <- function(temp_F) {
  temp_K <- fahrenheit_to_kelvin(temp_F) # It first converts fahrenheit to kelvin 
  temp_C <- kelvin_to_celsius(temp_K) # And then kelvin to Celsius
  return(temp_C)
}

```

I am over commenting it, since the name of the functions are quite self explanatory, one wouldn't need to comment as much.

### Organise all source files in the same directory

It is a good idea to store all the necessary files that will be used/sourced in your code in the same directory. You can use the respective relative path to access them. You will learn later how to do it through R projects.

### Data Cleaning

In many cases your data will be "dirty": it will need significant preprocessing to get into a format R (or any other programming language) will find useful. This task is sometimes called "data munging". I find it useful to store these scripts in a separate folder, and create a second "read-only" data folder to hold the "cleaned" data sets. 

## Project management

Managing your projects in a reproducible fashion doesn't just make your science reproducible, it also makes your life easier! Rstudio is here to help us with that by using projects!!

RStudio projects make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents.

Let's create our first project!

## Creating your first project

### Project

RStudio projects are associated with R working directories. You can create an RStudio project:

- In a brand new directory
- In an existing directory where you already have R code and data
- By cloning a version control (Git or Subversion) repository

There are many ways one could organise a project folder. [Good enough practicies in scientific computing ](https://github.com/swcarpentry/good-enough-practices-in-scientific-computing/blob/gh-pages/good-enough-practices-for-scientific-computing.pdf) gives the following recommendations for project organization:

1. Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project.
2. Put text documents associated with the project in the **doc** directory.
3. Put raw data and metadata in the **data** directory, and files generated during cleanup and analysis in a **results** directory.
4. Put source for the project's scripts and programs in the **src** directory, and programs brought in from elsewhere or compiled locally in the **bin** directory.
6. Name all files to reflect their content or function.


### Exercise: Build and outline your first project

Time: 10 min

To create a new project use the Create Project command (available on the Projects menu and on the global toolbar):

![](images/projects_new.png)

Choose the option New Directory -> Empty directory -> and place it in a path where you usually have your study/work-related documents. 

Now, navegate towards the directory that you just created your project at and double click at the your project file **.Rproj**.

You are inside of a project session. So now you can create the following folders using the bottom function "New folder":

1. doc
2. data
3. results
4. src
5. bin

### Advantages of using projects

Projects are used to make life easier. Once a project is opened within RStudio the following actions are taken:

- A new R session (process) is started
- The .Rprofile file in the project's main directory (if any) is sourced by R
- The .RData file in the project's main directory is loaded (if project options indicate that it should be loaded).
- The .Rhistory file in the project's main directory is loaded into the RStudio History pane (and used for Console Up/Down arrow command history).
- The current working directory is set to the project directory.
- Previously edited source documents are restored into editor tabs
- Other RStudio settings (e.g. active tabs, splitter positions, etc.) are restored to where they were the last time the project was closed.

### Exercise: let's output some results to our results folder
Time: 10 min

Imagine that you are a scientist, going from europe to US in order to work with climate change. The problem is that the country where you are, the system is fahrenheit based, but you have no clue on what temperature that translates to celsius. You need to show to your boss that you are able to transform the temperatures.

You have your computer, no smartphone and no internet. But you DO have a function to convert temperatures from fahrenheit to celsius (the one presented in the begin of this session). 

You are asked now to produce a plot that address the relationship of the two temperature systems. This plot will then be saved as a pdf into your results folder. Don't panic! I will give you a hint on how to create the plot and save it (follow my R comments). 

```{r}

## Range of "normal values" that you have seen in the last couple of days while in US:

fahrenheit_values = seq(0,120, 5)
celcius_vealues = vector()

for(i in 1:length(fahrenheit_values)){
  celcius_vealues[i] <-  fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit_values[i]) 
}

# Have a look at the results:
#celcius_vealues

# Now, plot the relationships using the function (plot):
# Have a look at the examples on how to plot:

# ?plot()

# Save the plot as a pdf:
# ?pdf() to the directory: results

```
