## Why try to be reproducible?

Well, first thing, reproducibility and replicability is a cornerstone of doing
science. However, the current concept of reproducibility relates more to
computational reproducibility: Hypothetically, if you gave someone your data,
your code, and your paper, would they be able to generate the exact same numbers
you report in your manuscript and in your tables and figures? Research shows
that this is not at all the case... even when the same researcher tries to
reproducible their own paper!

Being reproducible and writing a reproducible document/manuscript does several
things for you:

1. Makes your science better.
1. Makes you more efficient and productive, since less time is spent between
coding and putting your results in the document.
1. Makes you more confident in your results, since what you report is what you 
actually got from the analysis.
1. Its actually a lot of fun! ;)

Let's get to learning about R Markdown!

## Markdown syntax

### Headers 

Such as for a section, subsection, subsubsection, etc.

> `# Header 1`
> 
> gives...
> 
> # Header 1

> `## Header 2`
> 
> gives...
> 
> ## Header 2

> `### Header 3`
> 
> gives...
> 
> ### Header 3

### Text formatting

- `**bold**` gives **bold**. 
- `*italics*` gives *italics*.
- `super^script^` gives super^script^.
- `sub~script~` gives sub~script~.

### Lists

Unnumbered list:

> ```
> - item 1
> - item 2
> - item 3
> ```
>
> gives...
>
> - item 1
> - item 2
> - item 3

Numbered list:

> ```
> 1. item 1
> 2. item 2
> 3. item 3
> ```
>
> gives...
>
> 1. item 1
> 2. item 2
> 3. item 3

### Block quotes

One can also create quotes:

> ```
> > Block quote 
> ```
>
> gives...
>
> > Block quote 


### Exercise: Construct an outline for a (hypthetical) paper

Time: 10 min

Open RStudio and create an `R Markdown` document:

**File -> New File -> R Markdown**

Save the file and call the file `exercise.Rmd`. In the R Markdown document,
include the following "Header 1" `#` sections:

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Material and Methods
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion

Compile it by pressing the icon `Knit to HTML` or by typing `Ctrl-Shift-K`. Then:

- Write some random words below the **Abstract section**, while using bold and
italics.
- Include an unnumbered list below **Introduction** listing two or three fake
objectives.
- Include a "Header 2" (`##`) called "Statistical analysis" below "Material and
Methods".

Compile ("knit"") the document again and see what happens.

### Adding footnotes, pictures, and links to your document

Footnotes can be done using the following command:

> ```
> Footnote[^1]
>
> [^1]: Footnote content
> ```
>
> gives...
>
> Footnote[^1]
>
> [^1]: Footnote content

A .png .jpeg or .pdf image can be attached in the following way:

> ```
> ![image caption](images/au_coders.jpeg)
> ```
>
> gives...
>
> ![image caption](images/au_coders.jpeg)

And a link can be linked in the following format:

> ```
> [Link](https://google.com)
> ```
>
> gives...
>
> [Link](https://google.com)

### Exercise: Add more to your Markdown document!

Time: 8 min

Now you are asked to include in your "skecthed article" what we just have learned.

1. Include a random picture with caption (of your research or of any .png you
find in your PC).
2. Include a footnote.
3. Include the link of the AUOC webpage (`https://au-oc.github.io`) in your document.
 
## The best part! Inserting R code

One of the most powerful and useful features of Rmarkdown, is its ability to
combine text and code in the same document! You can insert plots by including a
code chunk like below. The options added to the code chunk tell it to add a
caption, and set the height and width of the figure.

<pre class="markdown"><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r plot_sepal, fig.cap="Figure title here", fig.height=8, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE}
plot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>

```{r intro_rmd_plot_sepal, fig.cap="Figure title here", fig.height=8, fig.width=8, echo=FALSE}
plot(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris)
```


You can also create tables by using the `kable()` function in the knitr package.

<pre class="markdown"><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}
knitr::kable(head(iris), caption = "Table caption here")
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(iris), caption = "Table caption here")
```

The `knitr::` part of the code tells R where the `kable` function comes from. So
the `::` is telling R "hey, look in the knitr package for the kable function".

For small and not too complex tables, you can also create it outside of a R
chunk using the Markdown syntax:

```
|       &nbsp;       | diverged | polymorphic |
|:------------------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
|   **synonymous**   |   1300   |    2109     |
| **non-synonymous** |   700    |     891     |
```

gives...

|       &nbsp;       | diverged | polymorphic |
|:------------------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
|   **synonymous**   |   1300   |    2109     |
| **non-synonymous** |   700    |     891     |

You can hide the code chunk but keep the output by using the `echo=FALSE` option:

<pre class="markdown"><code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r, echo=FALSE}
cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
&#96;&#96;&#96;
</code></pre>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
```

### Inline R code

You can also include R code within the text. You can use this to directly insert
numbers into the text of the document. By using something like:

> The mean of the sepal length is <code>&#96;r round(mean(iris$Sepal.Length), 2)&#96;</code>.
>
> Gives...
>
> The mean of the sepal length is `r round(mean(iris$Sepal.Length), 2)`.

### Exercise: Add a plot and table to "Results"

Time: 10 min

You now need to create a chunck of code in the **Results section**. If you have
any plot from your own research that you want to create feel free to do it so.
Otherwise you can just use the iris data:

1. Use `names(CO2)` to find the names of columns from the CO2 dataset. Choose
two columns. Create a code chunk with a caption `fig.cap` option and the
`fig.width` of 10 and a `fig.height` of 6. Include in the code chunk the
function, replacing the `__` with the two columns you chose:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    plot(___ ~ ___, data = CO2)
    ```

2. Create a table of the `head()` of the `CO2` dataset using the R function
`knitr::kable()`.
3. Create an inline R code that shows the sum of 2 plus 2 (`2 + 2`).
4. Try to make a similar table as the one below, but using your own Markdown
syntax in your document.

| Weather | Activity |
|---------|----------|
| Sunny | Beach or biking |
| Snowy | Movies or reading |

## Other features

### Citing literature with Rmarkdown

If you want to insert a citation use `[@Hoejsgaard2006a]` to get it to look
like: [@Hoejsgaard2006a]... the reference is then inserted onto the bottom of
the document. You need to add a line to the YAML header like this:

```
---
title: "My report"
author: "Me!"
bibliography: my_references.bib
---
```

### Making your report prettier

This really only applies to HTML and PDF[^tinytex] documents. If you want to change the 
theme, add an option to the YAML header so it looks like:

```
---
title: "My report"
output:
    html_document:
        theme: sandstone
---
```

Check out the R Markdown
[documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#appearance-and-style)
for more types of themes you can use for HTML documents.

[^tinytex]: Knitting to PDF will require that you install LaTeX using the
[tinytex](https://yihui.name/tinytex/r/) R package. After you install LaTeX you
can create truly beautifully typeset PDF documents.

## Ending remarks

We hope that we've shown the power that comes with using R Markdown and that
we've convinced you enough to try using R Markdown for writing your reports! 
Believe us, it can save soooo much time in the end after you've learned how to
incorporate text with R code when writing any type of document that relies on 
results from data analysis or presentation. R Markdown is a powerful tool for
reproducibility and for creating beautiful reports! There are many other amazing
features of R Markdown that you can learn about from the resources above. Try it
